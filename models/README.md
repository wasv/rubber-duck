# Put Deepspeech Models Here

Due to the size (~1GB) of the Deepspeech models, the files are not included here.

They can be obtained from: https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/latest
The links ending in models.pbmm and models.scorer are the ones to download.

Or if you have both the GitHub CLI client and the jq command available,
you can use the ./get-models.sh script to download the latest version of both files
automatically using GitHub's GraphQL API.
